public class CRT 
{
}

/* 
1.	Pi, circle object declared in client code, area and other methods, radius, other data declared that isn’t supposed to be changed.
2.	The constructor class must have the same name as the class name.  
3.	A public access modifier indicates that the class is visible to the client code. A private access modifier indicates that the item is visible to the class, but not the client code.
4.	This is invalid, the application will run with the radius as 2 and ignore the 5, so there’s no real reason for it to be there.
5.	 
	a.	Roo
	b.	X 
	c.	getX, calculate
	d.	setX 
	e.	factor
	f.	public Roo
	g.	5 methods
6.	A class is a data type that defines variables for the state of an object or its behavior. An object is the instance of a class; it stores data and can perform actions. */
